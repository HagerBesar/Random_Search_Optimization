Metaheuristic algorithms are increasingly popular in solving complex optimization problems in various fields. These algorithms offer an alternative approach to traditional optimization methods and are often used to solve problems that are difficult to solve with conventional algorithms. In this post, we will discuss the implementation of four popular metaheuristic algorithms:

- Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Nearest Neighbor 
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
